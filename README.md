# Dart Null Safety Bug: Unexpected Null Check Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue related to null checks and the null-aware operator (`??`) within a Dart class method.  The bug arises when attempting to access a nullable instance variable directly and using the `??` operator to provide a default value.

## Bug Description
The `MyClass` class contains a nullable instance variable `_myVariable`.  The `myMethod()` attempts to print the value of `_myVariable`, using the `??` operator to handle potential null values. While this appears to be a safe approach, unexpected behavior can occur depending on how the class is instantiated and how the null-check is implemented.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.dart` file.
3. Observe the output.

## Solution
The recommended approach is to always use a variable to check and assign the default value. The example bugSolution.dart shows the right way to handle this situation.
